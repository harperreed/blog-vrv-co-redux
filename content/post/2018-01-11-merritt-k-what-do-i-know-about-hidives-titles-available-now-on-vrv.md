Have you heard the good news, stranger? [HIDIVE is coming to VRV](https://vrvblog.co/staff/3652/changes-to-vrv-premium/), and bringing with them not just a wave of simulcast subbed anime, but their entire library of dubbed content. We&#8217;ll be adding more of their content over the course of the month, but today, the HIDIVE channel is launching with some of their best titles. What titles, you ask?

Regular readers will know that I&#8217;m unfamiliar with most anime. They may recall my [&#8220;Expectations vs. Reality&#8221;](https://vrvblog.co/merrittk/2026/expectations-vs-reality-hunter-x-hunter/) series, in which I compared my assumptions about various shows with the cold hard truth, revealed to me upon watching a few episodes. In honor of HIDIVE&#8217;s launch on VRV, I thought I&#8217;d take a stab at guessing my way through a few of these titles.

# Monster Musume

Okay, this is a harem show except instead of normal human ladies, this lucky lad is surrounded by monster girls of all shapes and sizes. There&#8217;s a lamia and also a spider lady and yowza are they both knockouts. I assume he gets into all kinds of hijinks typical of the genre—will he pick one? None of them? Will their jealousy spill out into full-blown combat? And why are all of these mythical lady creatures drawn to this dude? I guess I&#8217;ll have to watch it to find out.

# High School of the Dead

![](https://i2.wp.com/vrvblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/HSO_KEY_1200x450-1024x384.jpg?resize=1024%2C384&#038;ssl=1)

I&#8217;m *pretty sure* this is the show that features that tity physics scene where people are shooting into between flappy boobs. Right? How could you not love that?

# Elfen Lied

![](https://i0.wp.com/vrvblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ELF_KEY_1200x450-1024x384.jpg?resize=1024%2C384&#038;ssl=1)

This is the one where they have to find and strip elves for some reason. Elves only have magical powers when they&#8217;re wearing clothes, like everybody. When you strip them, they don&#8217;t know what to do with their hands. If they [just had a belt with pockets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy3Ccx4p__E) they could stick them in there. (Immediate revision: this is totally wrong and I was thinking of Those Who Hunt Elves. Well, you can&#8217;t win &#8217;em all.)

# Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?

![](https://i2.wp.com/vrvblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WPG_01_KEY_1200x450-1024x384.jpg?resize=1024%2C384&#038;ssl=1)

Yes. No. Maybe. It depends. Generally speaking I think treating any workplace as your lady zoo is gross, so potion sellers and healers are out of the question. But if you just run into another band of adventurers? Well, as long as you&#8217;re polite and can take no for an answer, I don&#8217;t see why not.

# The Thousand Musketeers

![](https://i0.wp.com/vrvblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/TNM_01_KEY_1200x450-1024x384.jpg?resize=1024%2C384&#038;ssl=1)

What this series proposes is that Alexandre Dumas simply wasn&#8217;t thinking big enough. &#8220;Three Musketeers isn&#8217;t cool,&#8221; it scoffs. &#8220;You know what&#8217;s cool? A thousand musketeers.&#8221; The only question in my mind is whether there are 250 each of d&#8217;Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, or there are just 1000 d&#8217;Artagnans, or some other combination.

I&#8217;m almost definitely wrong about a lot of these, but I look forward to learning the realities over the coming months. Stay tuned as we add more titles from HIDIVE&#8217;s library over the coming weeks, and take a *dive—*sorry, I&#8217;m trying to delete it—into these and the other shows available now!
