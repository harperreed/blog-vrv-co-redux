As anime fans, we know that our favorite shows can inspire us to stay strong, improve ourselves, and work toward our dreams. Very few people know that better than Green Bay Packers defensive end Mike Daniels. And in a new documentary produced by Crunchyroll, he shares his love of and exuberance for anime with all of us.

[*He Was Anime &#8211; The Mike Daniels Story*](https://vrv.co/series/GRQW4DPPR/He-Was-Anime-NFLs-Mike-Daniels) takes its title from Daniels&#8217;s parents&#8217; observations on his youthful fandom. From an early Piccolo cosplay to further friendships with like-minded fans, Daniels has never made a secret of his love of *[Dragon Ball](https://vrv.co/series/G6NQM3QX6/Dragon-Ball-Super), [Hunter x Hunter](https://vrv.co/series/GY3VKX1MR/Hunter-x-Hunter),* and other favorite series.

And, to his parents&#8217; credit, they&#8217;re doing their best to keep up!

The self-proclaimed &#8220;dork with muscles&#8221; also takes time to talk about the less fun parts of his life. Daniels was bullied in school, and found an outlet both in his love of anime and in sports. Both he and his father look to the powerful characters of series like *Dragon Ball* for inspiration when it comes to training.

If you know Mike Daniels from his football career, *He Was Anime* is an eye-opening look into his fandom. And if you&#8217;re just now meeting him, there&#8217;s no better way we can think of.

## [*He Was Anime &#8211; The Mike Daniels Documentary* is available to watch starting today on VRV!](https://vrv.co/series/GRQW4DPPR/He-Was-Anime-NFLs-Mike-Daniels)
