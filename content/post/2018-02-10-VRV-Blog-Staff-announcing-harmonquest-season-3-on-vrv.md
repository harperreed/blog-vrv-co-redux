Do you like roleplaying games? Of course you do! They&#8217;re excuses for friends to get together and be doofuses while slaying imaginary dragons. Now, what if your friends were all famous funny people? And what if you weren&#8217;t playing at all, but sitting back and watching them do it instead? Then you&#8217;d have *Harmonquest*, a show where Dan Harmon, Spencer Crittenden, Erin McGathy, and Jeff B. Davis play fantasy RPG *Pathfinder *for your amusement and edification.
