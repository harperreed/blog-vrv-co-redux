Any online sex worker will tell you the same thing—the job is so much more than what we put on social media, and frequently our only real breaks are to sleep or do something else that’s essential to our offline lives. This is especially true for me and people like me, because of my interests and my niche—games, animation, and net aesthetics—the introverted creative independent’s special.

The first thing I do when I wake up is check the calendar to see what I’ve planned and weigh that against my mental and physical state. Sometimes moving things around is helpful, but I generally fall into a brief state of despair any time I can’t do exactly what I’d set out to. A lot of time is lost to the productive and necessary process of planning and creating hype, and that’s the one thing I count on to get me going.

My calendar is a two-a-day rotation of the following: stream, shoot, gym, clean, personal care, strategy, event prep, crafting, and errands. Prioritization and consistency frequently conflict so being flexible is imperative. For instance, it’s unlikely that I’m able to stream on the same day I shoot and vice versa. Activities like cleaning and going to the gym require the most rigid schedule as they take up a large amount of energy and are the most likely to throw an entire week off track. Things like personal care and strategy are generally low-impact but often end up sprinkled in sporadically as the more heavily prioritized activities take precedence. And depending on the day of the week, event prep and crafting can be appended to streaming as a way to ease my anxiety over any lack of online activity. 

It’s such a go-with-the-flow type of work that you end up grinding constantly in spite of yourself, which is what creates that sensation of working at all times. Just like any kind of working from home, there’s no external directive or quitting time unless you enforce them yourself. As is typical of any creative job, the inner conflict between doing your best and doing just enough to sustain yourself is perpetual.

After I figure out what I’m doing, I spend as much time as possible doing those things amidst any additional responsibilities that present themselves. When I’m taking a break, I browse online for costume supplies, stream attire, equipment for event shows, and the like. Any use of social media is a never-ending process of curation and interaction to keep myself on the up and up regarding recent issues, trends, releases, and events. 

I follow a lot of artists and animators on top of accounts that post things of interest to me outside of work, as well as fellow sex workers—in this way, I feel like I give myself a broader range of influences. I don’t have the best skills in regard to this part of the work if my analytics are any indication, but I do partly blame for this my active decision to lay low while I’m still finishing my degree.

On a streaming or shooting day, I take roughly two hours to get ready after spending a lot of time stretching and, honestly, just trying to relax. To help with that, I do breathing exercises during makeup and wardrobe. I typically spend about five hours streaming, but if I’m feeling more energetic I try to go longer. The filming process is quite similar—the main difference for me is that certain concepts are extremely hard to execute and film by myself, and due to various restrictions, such as biology—human bodies being the fickle things that they are compared to animated ones—and limited workspace, it can take up to three attempts for me to get enough footage to continue to post-production. 

Before filming, I usually spend a time figuring out what kind of themes I want to reference and what feelings I want to elicit, besides the obvious. While surface level canon isn’t crucial to me personally, It’s important for me to demonstrate some semblance of awareness about the character and scenario in my videos in order to increase the appeal to fans. To do this, I use storyboards and pull together a loose narrative that won’t distract too much from the aesthetics but can be easily identified and enjoyed in tandem. This can be based on the character’s archetype, their romantic disposition, alternate universe potential, or other cheese holes in the existing media I’m trying to reference. 

One example is a long-term project I&#8217;ve been working on—Black Hanekawa from the *Monogatari* series. To do justice to the elements of this series that appeal most to its audience, I substitute costume canon for canon look and feel, including typography, color story, and niche references—including a notoriously difficult tongue-twister. Incorporating these types of elements into my content makes it feel like more of a labor of love.

Filming and editing usually takes a combined 48 hours per project. A surprising amount of time is spent on mundane tasks like fixing audio issues, cleaning up glitter or fake blood, and brushing tangled wigs. Often, reshoots are required because cosplay adds a thick layer of possibility for things to go awry, and it’s also very tiring to perform in a wig and costume; self-shot photosets are a yet deeper layer of hell in that regard. For instance, for my most recent video release, I wore my Earth-chan cosplay a total of four separate times to get all the footage I needed—including the yandere roleplay, main porn components, subliminal environmentalism, and a bonus scene called “Earth-chan’s Special Oil”. 

On days I don’t stream or film, I tend to anything that got deprioritized or pushed back. Sometimes I dedicate a night to watching tutorials, making graphics, or reading, but it’s very rare for me to veer away from subjects that don’t contribute to work in some way. 

On the other hand, while it is easy for me to justify a night spent cruising hentai image boards and playing *Dark Souls*—because it’s something I can honestly say is work-related—I still can’t shake the sense of guilt any time I find myself enjoying something without making content out of it, a syndrome familiar to plenty of creative people regardless of their field. Because of this, I often try to stream while gaming, crafting, and doing other hobby activities like building gunpla and drawing.

# Making Sense of the Work

The process of navigating the market and deploying content strategy varies from person to person. It’s seemingly effective to see what’s popular and new in terms of anime and games and ride the hype train into NSFW territory with your own content, however it’s also common to simply choose media that personally speaks to you. 

My production cycle begins at a point of interest—a character from a series, a game, or a personified meme. For example, to choose which kanmusu, or “shipgirl” I wanted to cosplay, I spent several hours on the wikis for the KanColle, Azur Lane, and Warship Girls series. I knew there were too many designs I would be tempted to cram into my queue, so I familiarized myself with most of the characters and weighed crafting viability against the preferences of my fan club members. Eventually, I settled on slowly working towards a cosplay of Seaport Hime—an ambitious undertaking for me personally, but one I was certain wouldn’t get overshadowed by other projects.

After deciding on a cosplay, the next step is nights on nights of rooting through whatever 2D reference material is available to find inspiration for costume modifications, posing, and concepts to use as a jump-off for my own content. Alternate outfits, crossovers, subversions, and Source Film Maker (SFM) hentai serve as great reference material.

Whenever I’m trying to put together a new character for a stream or shoot, I try to bear in mind that costume accuracy matters far less than authenticity in terms of the hair, makeup, lenses, and other cosmetic features. This is personal preference, but I feel it helps me pinpoint fine details to reference the character and establish canonical or derivative aesthetics. This consideration arises from the fact that one of the main differences between 2D and 3D porn is the impact physics have on effectively creating or destroying the uncanny valley effect I strive for when making videos. 

Clothing will always cover more skin in real life, hair needs to be styled to not obscure makeup, and minor details like skin quality are instantly magnified through HD cameras—so despite mixed reviews on my use of editing, I tend to go my own way and err on the side of poreless using overexposure. 

Each character poses the question of whether I should make the costume, construct a subversion using found items, or find a quality replica outright. I’ve found myself making decisions regarding this on a case by case basis, and while I’m not always entirely satisfied with the result, it’s important to be flexible. This is due to the lack of emphasis on clothing, as well as the fact that making everything by hand for every character would render the rest of the production process practically impossible when weighed against any sort of timeline or schedule. 

I don’t consider myself an authority on the subject, but it seems to me that in the crossover of cosplay and porn, it’s very easy to get hung up on details and redundancies due to conflicting ideologies on what will make a piece of content viable. I can’t count how many times I’ve felt like I can’t go on with my job simply because I’d failed when trying to construct a costume using materials or techniques that were new to me, or felt like I was cheating because my final product was incomplete, or even questioned my integrity because I was tempted to cosplay a character from a fandom that was foreign to me. 

It never really pans out to be as meaningful or existential as it seems, but when you’re a young, self-employed creative chasing the realization of a fantasy that could look like any one of a billion things at the whim of your ambiguous, often anonymous, audience, it gets intense.

# Real Struggle Hours

One issue that I feel is unique to making explicit content in this niche is the fact that many people truly feel that your videos belong to everyone. By choosing to embody something that most people either access for free or after paying a considerable amount for its original form, they feel a sense of ownership over your image and the way you use it. This makes it exceptionally difficult to seek copyright action, both because many sites will put your own content behind a paywall or hide their contact information, and because at a certain point it becomes more useful to simply have it out there and make your own account to tell viewers where they might find more. 

Either way, once you’re making porn in cosplay, you’re at the mercy of a multi-layered onslaught of critiques that range from demands of more free content to demands of suicide. To many people, the sanctity of their fandom completely eclipses any sense of social grace or rationality. I’ve even gotten death threats over my non-canonical representations of characters—and while I don’t consciously take things like that to heart, it’s a little alarming to think that something so arbitrary could be so triggering—for both parties.

Another issue, which I feel is often the elephant in the room, is the moral ambiguity of cosplay content as a form of artistic expression. Despite the possibility that I may be alienating my audience, I have a list of restrictions regarding my content because it is explicit in nature. Many characters and scenarios lie outside of what I personally feel is acceptable to pornify, and I tend to stand my ground in opposing the view that nothing is harmful as long as it’s a fantasy. 

While I don’t disagree that the line between fantasy and reality is quite clear in the 3D world of cosplay porn, my intent with my content isn’t to highlight or reinforce that line, so I can’t speak for how clear it is to my audience. Therefore, the idea of cosplaying characters below a certain age range in a sexual context feels both uncomfortable and unnecessary to me. 

There have been many occasions where this has sparked debate in my chat, and it’s a challenge to navigate while trying to maintain and relaxing and fun atmosphere. Ultimately, I feel that the separation between fantasy and reality should lie in content versus context, respectively—and although conversations surrounding this tend to result in an impasse, it’s something that’s at the forefront of many cosplayers’ interactions with their audience. It’s one thing to make a distinction between fantasy and reality based on a model’s true age, but it’s another to state that as long as it is marked with the appropriate rating, any and all content should be permissible. 

To me, the most crucial aspect of explicit streamer life is fully embracing and feeding off my own station as a social pariah—both online and IRL. It’s one thing to be a camwhore, another to be a cosplayer, yet another to be a female gamer; combining all three adds a generous helping of scrutiny from all sides, as well as an overarching layer of anxiety with regards to one’s performance within these communities. 

When you’re faced with a trifecta of gatekeeping, the ubiquitous criticism and cries of “get a real job” become strikingly ineffectual—and while, in theory, succeeding in this line of work should eventually allow me a certain degree of social mobility, it is both restricting and isolating in the meantime. 

I feel as though I am unable to face any mass social event without mass anxiety, not just because it’s intrinsic but also, logically, because it could endanger me. At school, if someone’s gaze lingers it makes me wonder if they’ve seen my Pornhub channel and if so, whether they might approach me or send me anonymous toxicity when they’re in front of their computer at home. Delving further into my interests through my work gives mixed reactions, and it’s up to me to navigate the costs and benefits of playing up or playing down the fact that I like games and anime. Feeling confident as a result of my personal achievements with streaming and content creation is undermined by my difficulty in communicating with people face-to-face, and being unable to properly explain what I do.

I often wonder what would come of changes in direction with my content, or how a switch to a different kind of streaming would play out, considering the recent changes in content policy across many social networks and content platforms. For example, after the advent of [SESTA/FOSTA](https://nylon.com/articles/sex-work-activism-sesta-fosta-life-death-issue), [platforms like Patreon have become decidedly more strict](https://patreonhq.com/checking-in-on-our-commitments-to-creators-about-trust-and-safety-8793a53c3cae) in terms of the content they allow their creators to post. And though some have managed to fly under the radar, it’s obvious that sex workers are definitely not welcome. 

Policy changes to sites like Patreon stem from misogyny and prevailing anti-sex worker sentiments and laws, and make the work more difficult. And there are broader issues I deal with common to any form of work under capitalism—it can be exhausting and demoralizing. I frequently alternate between extreme gratitude—even pride—and a sense of being overwhelmed. The duality of being on and offline is very real and difficult to explain in brief interactions with an ephemeral audience. 

But for all the trials and struggles involved, it’s creative work that involves my interests and hobbies. And it&#8217;s still kind of uncharted territory. For the time being, I’m just figuring out my way in and around this vocation—and how it fits into the emerging class of self-made net NEETs who turn themselves into content to try and turn a profit.
