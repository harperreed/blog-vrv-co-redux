It&#8217;s a tale as old as time: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy turns into milk cow and falls in love with South Korea&#8217;s first satellite.

The story of *Satellite Girl and Milk Cow* is, to say the least, out of this world. Pun completely intended. And yet, the odd love story resonates even without taking its fantastical elements into consideration. Written and directed by Hyeong-yoon Jang, it&#8217;s at its heart a story of a heartbroken boy and a lonely girl who find each other under odd circumstances.

## The World of *Satellite Girl and Milk Cow*

First and foremost, Il-ho &#8212; our heroine &#8212; is actually quite real. Or, more specifically, her satellite form is. KITSAT-1 was launched in 1992, with the purpose of conducting audiovisual experiments and taking photos of Earth. In the world of the film, KITSAT-1 continues to do this, eventually discovering beautiful music that it wants to learn more about. And so, it hurtles to Earth to explore&#8230; and becomes a robot girl in the process.

Meanwhile, young musician Kyung-chun discovers that his girlfriend is seeing someone else, and subsequently turns into a milk cow. And, all things considered, that&#8217;s not completely unheard of in this world. A magical power turns heartbroken people into animals, who are then hunted for their livers. Kyung-chun has remained under the radar since then, but KITSAT-1 &#8212; now going under the name Il-ho &#8212; searches him out. With help from a magical roll of toilet paper named Merlin.

The logic of *Satellite Girl and Milk Cow* is bizarre, but you eventually find yourself along for the ride. And then, when Il-ho and Kyung-chun begin falling for each other as the world begins to close in around them, you will find yourself rooting for a farm animal and a piece of space junk to fall in love. We&#8217;d say &#8220;for the first time&#8221; but we don&#8217;t judge.
