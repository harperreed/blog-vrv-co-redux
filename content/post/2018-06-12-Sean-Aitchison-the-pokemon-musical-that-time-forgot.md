### üé∂¬†Pok√©mon is the one thing in life I can control

Not too long ago, I ventured down the hedgehog hole of [‚Äúearly Sonic canon,‚Äù](https://vrvblog.co/aitchison/3952/reading-the-old-testament-of-sonic-the-hedgehog/) an example of Americanization of a Japanese media property at its finest. Believe it or not, there is an even weirder example of this process at work in another beloved game franchise‚ÄîPok√©mon. And no, I‚Äôm not talking about the upcoming Detective Pikachu film. I‚Äôm talking about the short-lived Pok√©mon stage musical known as Pok√©mon Live!, a joint production of Nintendo, 4Kids Entertainment and Radio City Entertainment.

Directed by Luis Perez, a veteran dancer and choreographer, Pok√©mon Live! premiered in September of 2000 at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City. It went on to tour North America for five months, during which it experienced mixed critical success and ultimately became a financial failure. What went wrong? Despite the franchise practically printing money for Nintendo at the time, it turned out that touring a stage production‚Äîone with monsters, elaborate sets, and a giant robot invented solely for the show‚Äîwas not a cost-effective proposition.

Unlike a game or a cartoon, a musical has to be performed anew every time‚Äîand If you missed in back in 2000, and didn‚Äôt catch the showings in Portugal, Belgium, or Dubai, then you were out of luck. Until recently, that is, when production stage manager Chris Mitchell uploaded the musical [in its entirety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDLj7hT1bk4) to YouTube. Let‚Äôs take a look, shall we?

## Cashing In On Pok√©Mania

The year is 2000. Pok√©mon is at the height of its popularity in America‚ÄîRed and Blue hit North American stores less than two years prior, the anime dub is well into its second season, Pok√©mon: The First Movie earned over $85 million in its North American release, and the trading cards have exploded onto the scene, transforming playgrounds everywhere into underground gambling rings.

Suffice to say, America had been officially hit by Pok√©mania, a term that TIME Magazine would soon coin to describe just how obsessed with the franchise the American youth had become, and the so called [‚Äúdangers‚Äù](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,34342,00.html) that came with it. Pocket monsters had taken the place of the turtles and rangers that came before them in the heart of American popular culture. 

American distributors of Pok√©mon were quick to cash in on the franchise‚Äôs popularity, bringing over as many products from Japan as possible while putting out a few creations of their own. One of these creations was Pok√©mon Live! The logic behind this decision was not entirely flawed. Pok√©mon was killing it in absolutely every medium it touched, and venturing out into another form of media‚Äîespecially a *ticketed event*‚Äîseemed like a solid plan. 

## Pok√©-Production (or ‚Äú151 Pok√©mon, Millions of Dollars‚Äù)

Nobody can say they weren‚Äôt ambitious‚ÄîPok√©mon Live! was a multi-million dollar show with a number of advanced effects and puppets, as well as 20 different choreographed musical numbers. All of it‚Äîthe casting, writing, construction‚Äîwas completed in just five months, an unusually short development cycle for a show of this kind. Miraculously, the show was ready to go just in time for its scheduled September premiere.

In 2016, Michael Slade, the musical‚Äôs writer, told [Game Informer](https://www.gameinformer.com/b/podcasts/archive/2016/09/15/writing-pokemon-live-nintendos-forgotten-musical.aspx)about one pitfall that came with the over-the-top production. All of the effects, costumes, and sets worked great in a single venue set up for the show, but the musical was expected to tour‚Äîwhich meant that everything had to be packed up and rebuilt at each location. As Slade tells it, the task required no less than eleven semi trucks.

Aside from transportation, some of the show‚Äôs biggest expenses were designer [Yvette Helin‚Äôs](http://www.yvettehelinstudio.com/index.htm) Pok√©mon costumes and puppets. Oddly, most of these were only showcased in the first and last musical numbers, the show effectively playing all of its best cards up front with few Pok√©mon appearances to follow until the grand finale. Possibly the most expensive Pok√©mon prop of them all was MechaMew2, a completely original Pok√©mon created by [Costume Armor Inc.](https://www.costumearmour.com/) specifically for the musical‚Äîan idea approved by and possibly originating from The Pok√©mon Company themselves. 

Built by Giovanni of Team Rocket in-universe, MechaMew2 was designed with the ability to learn any move and amplify its power simply by encountering it in battle, making it a seemingly-unstoppable weapon in the service of the crime syndicate‚Äôs plans to take over the world. The robomon even appeared on a collectible card handed out at showings. It isn‚Äôt usable in the Pok√©mon card game, but it does list the monster‚Äôs dimensions‚Äî10 feet tall, 7 feet wide, 8 feet deep and over two tons in weight‚Äîwhich some believe were the actual prop‚Äôs measurements. Despite‚Äîor perhaps because of‚Äîthis gigantic stature, MechaMew2 was unable to amplify and return the investment its real-life designers had made in it. 

## The Pok√©-Plot

The story of Pok√©mon Live! was adapted from a combination of the English dub of the anime and two American soundtracks that had been released prior to the musical‚Äôs production, Pok√©mon 2.B.A. Master and Totally Pok√©mon. These albums are too weird to fully explore here, but it‚Äôs enough to know that they‚Äôre collections of songs that were included in the English dub‚Äîhits like ‚ÄúViridian City‚Äù and the infamous ‚ÄúPok√©Rap‚Äù‚Äîand a few original tracks that were inspired by the show and helped build the story for Pok√©mon Live!

![](https://i2.wp.com/vrvblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image8-1024x528.jpg?resize=1024%2C528&#038;ssl=1)

Since most of the songs were written beforehand, with only four original numbers being developed for the musical, the narrative of Pok√©mon Live! was more-or-less Frankensteined together from the lyrics of these songs and elements from the anime, with a few original concepts to stitch it all together. You can read a version of the script [here](https://archive.org/stream/PokemonLiveScript/Pokemon_Live_Script_djvu.txt) if you‚Äôre interested.

The plot depicts Ash (Dominic Nolfi), Brock (Dennis Kenny) and Misty (Heidi Weyhmueller) as they journey to obtain the Diamond Badge from a mysterious new Pok√©mon Gym, which turns out to be part of Team Rocket‚Äôs plot to take over the world, as Giovanni has been using MechaMew2 to learn the move of every Pok√©mon that challenges it. Along the way, Ash encounters Jessie and James (played by Lauren Kling and Andrew Rannells‚Äîthe latter of whom musical theatre fans may recognize as the lead in the original cast of Book of Mormon, as well as a voice actor on the Pok√©mon anime) and learns the usual kids‚Äô media lessons of friendship and love. 

It was a mostly by-the-book plot with a couple of interesting ideas‚Äîfor the audience of the time, it was a solid B+ of a production. But, as it tends to be the case with early Americanizations of Japanese properties, the producers decided the text wasn‚Äôt weird enough as it was and couldn‚Äôt help but toss some of their own ideas into the mix. 

## Love and Rockets

Some of the most out-there elements of Pok√©mon Live!‚Äôs story were the romantic subplots. Yes, subplots, as inplural. One of the main threads of the narrative is that Misty was deeply in love with Ash and can‚Äôt find the right way to express her feelings. Of course, fans have shipped the two characters for years, but there was never any confirmation in the anime that they had feelings for each other, only suggestions in the form of gags. That is, until the release of Pok√©mon 2.B.A. Master. 

![](https://i1.wp.com/vrvblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image3-2-1024x528.jpg?resize=1024%2C528&#038;ssl=1)

One of the tracks on this album, entitled ‚ÄúMisty‚Äôs Song,‚Äù has Misty singing of her secret love for Ash. This served as the basis of Misty‚Äôs story in the play, snowballing into a pretty significant subplot wherein she scolds Ash for forgetting her birthday, belts out this song after Jigglypuff puts Ash and Brock to sleep‚Äîa number that involved an out-of-place dance performed by two plain-costumed actors and a random appearance from a Mew puppet‚Äîand tells Ash that his Pikachu abandoned him because he‚Äôs a terrible friend‚Äîyou know, typical romance.

Misty‚Äôs crush on Ash is definitely bizarre, but it‚Äôs not the most bizzare romantic subplot of the musical‚Äôs story. No, that title belongs to Ash‚Äôs mom, Delia Ketchum. Half of Delia‚Äôs story focuses on her past as Giovanni‚Äôs girlfriend and member of the gang that would form Team Rocket.

Yes, that‚Äôs right, sweet Delia Ketchum was once the gangster girlfriend of a man who seeks world domination on a weekly basis. This wasn‚Äôt a throwaway gag either, a background detail put in without a thought‚Äîit was a major plot point that partially motivated Giovanni‚Äôs actions and drove a wedge between Ash and his mom after he found out about her checkered past. And 4Kids actually approved of the idea, going so far as to endorse the proposition of Giovanni being revealed as Ash‚Äôs father‚Äîa plot point that, thankfully, didn‚Äôt make it into the final product, though it has been speculated about by fans for years.

The undoubted highlight of the musical‚Äîfor both kids watching it in 2000 and a 20-something watching it now‚Äîis a song entitled ‚ÄúThe Best at Being the Worst.‚Äù This was a tango number between Jessie and James as they lamented their many blunders in trying to capture the elusive Pikachu for Giovanni, failing to even dance properly throughout. It‚Äôs surreal and bonkers and glorious all at the same time.

Other strange highlights include James asking Giovanni his thoughts on ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Ask, Don‚Äôt Tell,‚Äù MechaMew2 learning the power of friendship and self-destructing to defy Giovanni, Psyduck scene transitions that desperately said, ‚ÄúLook kids, we get this show!‚Äù and my personal favorite, a musical number between acts in which a personification of Ash‚Äôs Pok√©dex named Dexter performs the rap song, ‚ÄúWhat Kind of Pok√©mon Are You?‚Äù from 2.B.A. Master as he dances with his ‚ÄúDextettes.‚Äù

## Reception and Legacy (Or Lack Thereof)

The Pok√©mon Musical advertised on an archived version of the official Pok√©mon website

Pok√©mon Live! vanished as quickly as it had arrived. ¬†Beyond reviews‚Äîwhich are rather scarce and vary from scathing disgust to praising it as a 21st Century version of ‚ÄúThe Magic Flute‚Äù‚Äîthere is very little historical information about the show aside from Michael Slade‚Äôs interview. 

I put out a call for stories from people who‚Äôd seen the musical as kids, but nothing came of it‚Äîas though it never existed. And, were it not for the YouTube uploads and archived websites, I‚Äôd be inclined to believe that Pok√©mon Live! was something we collectively dreamed up‚Äîa show everyone remembers but that nobody seems to have actually seen. 

But Pok√©mon Live! was very real, and it perfectly encapsulates the whirlwind American encounter with Japanese pop culture at turn of the century‚Äîa time when a stage musical based on the soundtrack based on the English dub of an anime that itself was based on a video game series could not only get made, but seemed like an amazing idea.
