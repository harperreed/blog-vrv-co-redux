01. **[My Love Story](https://vrv.co/series/G6MGPGZ86/MY-love-STORY?utm_source=editorial_cr&amp;utm_medium=vrv_blog&amp;utm_campaign=vrv-linking&amp;referrer=editorial_cr_vrv_blog_vrv-linking)**

One of the most feel-good romantic comedies in anime, My Love Story is a great substitute for MMO Junkie’s relentless positivity. Takeo Goda is a tall, muscular high school student with thick eyebrows. He’s a romantic but his pursuit of love is constantly foiled by his best friend Sunakawa. Takeo’s size makes him intimidating to the girls of the school while Sunakawa’s legendary good looks attract everyone to him. That is, until Rinko falls in love with Takeo after he saves her from a harasser in a train. What follows is the story of Takeo and Rinko awkwardly navigating love through mutual support and with the help of their friends. The series avoids many of the romantic comedy anime tropes, focusing on real-life challenges like first kisses and Valentine’s Day instead of romantic rivals and mysterious childhood promises.

02. [**Princess Jellyfish**](https://vrv.co/series/GRVN4DPDY/Princess-Jellyfish?utm_source=editorial_vrv&amp;utm_medium=vrv_blog&amp;utm_campaign=vrv-linking&amp;referrer=editorial_vrv_vrv_blog_vrv-linking)

This series is perhaps the most similar premise to MMO Junkie of all these recommendations for its focus on recluse culture and gender subversion. Princess Jellyfish is a romantic comedy telling the story of Tsukimi, an artist obsessed with jellyfish living in the Amamizukan apartment building, a women&#8217;s only dorm populated by NEET women. She has a fateful encounter with Kuranosuke, a beautiful woman who she discovers is actually the cross-dressing illegitimate son of a Tokyo politician. He takes an interest in the residents of the dorm, despite having to keep his gender under wraps to avoid violating their “no men” rule and offers aid when they find themselves fighting to keep their complex from being demolished for redevelopment. The manga won the Kodansha Award and has an anime adaptation with a live-action TV series on the way!

03. **[ReLIFE](https://vrv.co/series/GY5VE008Y/ReLIFE?utm_source=editorial_cr&amp;utm_medium=vrv_blog&amp;utm_campaign=vrv-linking&amp;referrer=editorial_cr_vrv_blog_vrv-linking)**

![04](https://i1.wp.com/vrvblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/04-2.gif?resize=762%2C418&#038;ssl=1)

Navigating modern work culture and the pursuit of personal happiness are a constant presence in the background of Moriko’s online questing and awkward romance. ReLIFE puts a laser focus on that struggle. It’s protagonist Arata Kaizaki quits his corporate job after 3-months and is unable to find new work besides a part-time position at a convenience store. He’s approached by a mysterious man who wants to make Kaizaki the test subject of a new government program known as ReLIFE, using a special medication that will regress his age 10 years and place him back in high school with the intention of allowing him to more successfully navigate that formative period of his life and fix what’s ailing him. The story has its share of surprises with other ReLIFE participants and some subversive elements looking a modern corporate culture in Japan that resonate with Moriko’s own falling out with her job.

04. **[Monthly Girls&#8217; Nozaki-kun](https://vrv.co/series/GY8V1N38Y/Monthly-Girls-Nozaki-kun?utm_source=editorial_cr&amp;utm_medium=vrv_blog&amp;utm_campaign=vrv-linking&amp;referrer=editorial_cr_vrv_blog_vrv-linking)**

![05](https://i1.wp.com/vrvblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/05-2.gif?resize=762%2C418&#038;ssl=1)

Nozaki-kun is another high school romantic comedy that plays with genre conventions. Chiyo Sakura has a crush on Umetaro Nozaki and, in the process of attempting to ask him out, ends up discovering his secret life as renowned shojo manga artist Sakiko Yumeno. Somehow she ends up working as his assistant and constantly has to reign back his outlandish story ideas all while trying to sort out her feelings. This anime is a bit more of a slow burn, falling back on the “will they won&#8217;t they” formula common in shojo manga with Chiyo’s struggles to confess her feelings to the oblivious Nozaki. For all that, it keeps things relatively stress free by putting you in the lives of a growing cast of eccentrics with some attachment to shojo manga, either as artists or real-life stereotypes.

05. **[Miss Kobayashi&#8217;s Dragon Maid](https://vrv.co/series/G6MGQEK46/Miss-Kobayashis-Dragon-Maid?utm_source=editorial_cr&amp;utm_medium=vrv_blog&amp;utm_campaign=vrv-linking&amp;referrer=editorial_cr_vrv_blog_vrv-linking)**

![06](https://i1.wp.com/vrvblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/06-1.gif?resize=808%2C446&#038;ssl=1)

A less obvious candidate for MMO Junkie fans is this romance story between a woman and her dragon who is also her maid. Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid is the same kind of goofy, loosely animated romcom with an equally charming cast. Although Moriko and Kobayashi are outwardly dissimilar, with Moriko having quit work at the beginning of the story and Kobayashi intensely involved in her job to the detriment of her personal relationships, both have issues with intimacy and self-image that they struggle with in the face of unexpected romantic interest. Both also overcome their own loneliness by discovering their place among a group of eccentrics. Dragon Maid is a heartfelt and happy story with moments of introspection that ground things.

06. **[Tsukigakirei](https://vrv.co/series/GYDQEDNK6/Tsukigakirei?utm_source=editorial_cr&amp;utm_medium=vrv_blog&amp;utm_campaign=vrv-linking&amp;referrer=editorial_cr_vrv_blog_vrv-linking)**

![07](https://i2.wp.com/vrvblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/07.gif?resize=808%2C446&#038;ssl=1)

A sleeper hit of last year, Tsukigakirei is an unusual romance for focusing on a mutual crush between two middle school students. Much like My Love Story, the story focuses heavily on firsts and discovering what love and being in a relationship really mean. The big MMO Junkie connection comes in the social anxiety experienced by the two leads, Kotaro and Akane. In addition to learning about relationships for the first time, the story explores their slow progress in learning how to communicate with one another and express affection. In the beginning, they’re only able to open up and be themselves over the chat application LINE but are overcome with awkwardness and uncertainty in person. It’s a story of discovery and reaching out to one another, motivated by love and the desire for self-improvement.

07. **[Chihayafuru](https://vrv.co/series/GYGG57V3Y/Chihayafuru?utm_source=editorial_cr&amp;utm_medium=vrv_blog&amp;utm_campaign=vrv-linking&amp;referrer=editorial_cr_vrv_blog_vrv-linking)**

![08](https://i0.wp.com/vrvblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08.gif?resize=808%2C446&#038;ssl=1)

Perhaps the strangest recommendation on this list, Chihayafuru mirrors the uniqueness of MMO Junkie.. Both series are difficult to pin down with popular anime storytelling tropes. Where MMO Junkie has its more middle-aged focus and quirky construct for introducing its romantic leads, Chihayafuru is part drama, part romance, part sports series. Chihaya Ayase is introduced to the traditional Japanese card game karuta. The story focuses on her quest to improve at the sport and rediscover the boy who showed her the world of karuta. This may be a bit of a stretch but both stories leave the feeling of coming from outside normal conventions of their genre.

08. **[Sword Art Online](https://vrv.co/series/GR49G9VP6/Sword-Art-Online?utm_source=editorial_cr&amp;utm_medium=vrv_blog&amp;utm_campaign=vrv-linking&amp;referrer=editorial_cr_vrv_blog_vrv-linking)**

![09](https://i1.wp.com/vrvblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09.gif?resize=808%2C446&#038;ssl=1)

Although the conditions under which Kirito and Asuna meet in an MMO in Sword Art Online couldn’t be more different than those of Hayashi and Lily, the two couples definitely have a lot in common. While the quests in Sword Art Online are life and death affairs, Kirito and Asuna have a mutually supportive relationship with both characters playing proactive roles and offering mutual support. If you’re into MMO Junkie for the gaming culture elements, there are plenty such references on offer in *SAO*. While the series movies into more action and intrigue-related subplots as it progresses, the first arc has a laser focus on Asuna and Kirito’s budding romance in a unique and deadly world. If you wanted an MMO Junkie with higher stakes, you’ve come to the right place!

09. **[Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches](https://vrv.co/series/GR49K1MP6/Yamada-kun-and-the-Seven-Witches?utm_source=editorial_cr&amp;utm_medium=vrv_blog&amp;utm_campaign=vrv-linking&amp;referrer=editorial_cr_vrv_blog_vrv-linking)**

![10](https://i0.wp.com/vrvblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10.gif?resize=808%2C446&#038;ssl=1)

If you love stories where everyone but the main characters are aware of their mutual affection, you&#8217;ll enjoy this quirky high school comedy. Yamada-kun features the protagonist Ryuu Yamada, a delinquent and outcast who finds himself in the middle of a magical conspiracy in his own school. Seven female students have magical powers that manifest when they kiss someone. He discovers this by accidentally kissing one of the school&#8217;s top performing students, Urara Shiraishi and learning she has the power to swap bodies. He quickly discovers that, despite her achievements, his perceptions of her perfect life were way off base. The story explores themes of agency, loneliness, obligation, and the personal struggles and lives individuals people keep hidden behind their public face.

10. **[Sakura Quest](https://vrv.co/series/G6K52XZWY/Sakura-Quest?utm_source=editorial_cr&amp;utm_medium=vrv_blog&amp;utm_campaign=vrv-linking&amp;referrer=editorial_cr_vrv_blog_vrv-linking)**

![11](https://i2.wp.com/vrvblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11.gif?resize=808%2C446&#038;ssl=1)

Although not a love story, *Sakura Quest* is an anime about working women that takes a deep dive into some of the social issues of MMO Junkie. Its cast is a group of misfits trying to hold up the failing economy of a town in rural Japan. Each harbors their own troubled past and personal struggles with the current economic environment and modern work culture. The anime offers an uncomfortable perspective of the victims of modern progress an all-too-real look at people who just aren’t sure what they can do to find meaning and prosperity in their own lives. The possible motivations for Moriko’s own rejection of modern work culture and retreat to the comfort of the virtual world play themselves out several times in this series. It doesn’t offer many solutions and may not be as upbeat as MMO Junkie, but is inspirational in its own way, showing characters trying, failing, and trying again.
