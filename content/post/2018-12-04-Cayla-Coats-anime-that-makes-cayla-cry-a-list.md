Hi, I&#8217;m Cayla! I work at VRV and I cry A LOT. One of the biggest contributing factors to this is the anime I watch, so I decided to make a recommendation list about just that: anime that make me cry.

[**March Comes in Like a Lion**](https://vrv.co/series/GRVNXWQZY/March-comes-in-like-a-lion?utm_source=editorial_vrv&amp;utm_medium=blog_vrv&amp;utm_campaign=Anime-That-Make-Cayla-Cry-A-List)

Rei Kiriyama is a very, very sad boy, but he&#8217;s trying his best! *March Comes in Like a Lion* catalogs his struggles with the pain and sadness that have grown inside of him because of past experiences, and his slow progression into a stronger person. While this show really understands how to impart to viewers what depression feels like, the parts that really messed me up were the uplifting segments where we get to watch Rei grow and learn how to depend on and grow closer to the people around him.

How Much Did Cayla Cry: Lots of tears with a few accompanying sniffles

[***A Place Further Than the Universe***](https://vrv.co/series/GYK541EPR/A-Place-Further-Than-the-Universe?utm_source=editorial_vrv&amp;utm_medium=blog_vrv&amp;utm_campaign=Anime-That-Make-Cayla-Cry-A-List)

This is the story of a girl who never gave up on her dream, even when everyone in her life doubted her. While this story of four friends journeying to Antarctica has its fair share of levity and jokey moments, when *A Place Further Than the Universe *wants to hit an emotional chord, it lands a critical hit. The eleventh episode has a particularly brilliant and cruel method of revealing an important plot point that I won&#8217;t spoil here, but it was a twist that diminished me into a gross lump of tears and snot. Come for the cute, fun time spent with friends and stay for the moments of gut-wrenching emotional vulnerability!

How Much Did Cayla Cry: Usually smiles with one or two tears, with some occasional sobbing

This show lights my shonen heart on FIRE. Yeah Kamina is really cool, but what gets me is waching Simon grow from a little scared weenie into a full-blown universe-saving hero! *Gurren Lagann* taught me that if you really want to grow stronger, it&#8217;s going to hurt a lot, and you&#8217;ll lose a lot of important things along the way, but it&#8217;s the only way to move forward. Simon&#8217;s journey makes me want to do my absolute best, even when it gets hard, and that optimism in the face of scary odds makes me TEARFUL AND HAPPY!

How Much Did Cayla Cry: Mostly just single tears while fist pumping during super hype moments, but there were a few episodes that beat me up emotionally

[***Flowers of Evil***](https://vrv.co/series/GR751923Y/Flowers-of-Evil?utm_source=editorial_vrv&amp;utm_medium=blog_vrv&amp;utm_campaign=Anime-That-Make-Cayla-Cry-A-List)

Have you ever watched something that makes you feel just *awful*? *Flowers of Evil* is a series that will make you miserable, but it&#8217;s also a weirdly rewarding watch. Kasuga and Nakamura are middle schoolers who are awful to each other, but the show is also pretty adamant about you understanding that they have reasons for behaving the way they do. While the series is unflinching in depicting how cruel people can be to each other, it&#8217;s also strangely empathetic, challenging the audience to sympathize with people who are just plain mean.

How Much Did Cayla Cry: This show made me cry bleak, emotionally exhausted tears, the kind you cry after reading too much sad French philosophy

[***Gintama***](https://vrv.co/series/GYQ4MKDZ6/Gintama?utm_source=editorial_vrv&amp;utm_medium=blog_vrv&amp;utm_campaign=Anime-That-Make-Cayla-Cry-A-List)

Ok *Gintama *is extremely funny but hear me out. This is one of the most emotionally affecting anime I HAVE EVER SEEN. Gintoki may seem like a goofy slacker idiot, but the scars he carries from the war against the Amanto aliens give him a striking amount of emotional depth. Character details like this are subtly woven into a lot of the cast so that when the show decides to turn serious, it actually holds weight. The fact that the vast majority of this anime is a comedy makes the dramatic elements that much stronger in comparison.

How Much Did Cayla Cry: Mostly tears induced by laughter, but once in a while it will make me sob like a DUMB BABY
