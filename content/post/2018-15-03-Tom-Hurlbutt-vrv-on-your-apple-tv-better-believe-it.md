Apple TV users feeling left out on all of the VRV fun? Then join the party with VRV Apple TV!

**Oh, it&#8217;s you again.**

Yep, I&#8217;m back with a new app announcement!

**Is it about the Nintendo Switch?!**

![Raging when you ask me that question](https://i1.wp.com/vrvblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mob-rage.gif?resize=640%2C358&#038;ssl=1)

**I take that as a, &#8220;No&#8221;&#8230;so I guess that leaves Apple TV.**

Yes! If you have a 4th generation Apple TV or an Apple TV 4K, you can go to the App Store on your device, search &#8220;VRV&#8221;, and download the app.

**Is it any different from the other VRV apps I use on my TV?**

It&#8217;s pretty much the same app. You can still do all of the neat activities you can on the other TV-connected apps with VRV Apple TV: find cool, new content and add it to your watchlist; browse curated content from the VRV home feed or from the various channels available on VRV; and binge tons of great content for free (or Go Premium to unlock even more content and have all of it ad-free!)

**Are there any cool features for the VRV Apple TV app that no other VRV app has?**

There is one. Apple TV has this feature called &#8220;Top Shelf&#8221; where by moving any of your apps to the top row will provide app-specific functionality right from the Apple TV homescreen:

By moving your VRV Apple TV app to the Top Shelf, you&#8217;ll see VRV featured content in addition to what&#8217;s popular on VRV. If you&#8217;re signed into your account, you&#8217;ll also see your most recent watchlist items and be able to continue watching right where you left off.

Aww, red pandas are the cutest&#8230;

WRONG! MY PRECIOUS CHILDREN ARE THE CUTEST CHANGE MY MIND

**Can I still use AirPlay to share from my iPhone or iPad to my Apple TV?**

Uh, well, yes you can STILL do that&#8230; buy why?

**So what&#8217;s next?**

That&#8217;s it for now in terms of new apps. Look forward to new updates across all of our applications and to more updates on the VRV Blog about new features and functionality to our different VRV products.
