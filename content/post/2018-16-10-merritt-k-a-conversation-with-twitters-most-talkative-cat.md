For decades, internet users have turned to cats to provide them some reprieve from social problems and their personal troubles. In the beginning, there was [longcat](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/longcat), [Caturday](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/caturday), and [That Fucking Cat](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/that-fucking-cat). Then, there were cheezburgers, Maru, keyboard cats, nyan, and so on—the list is endless, and the sheer quantity of shared cat material online suggests that they may have been the engine that launched meme culture out of the orbit of sites like 4chan and onto the general internet.

This is the reality we now live in, in which one can purchase cat meme books at Spencer&#8217;s Gifts and easily follow any number of cat accounts on Twitter.

Surely, then, cat content has run its course? Surely we, as a culture, have moved on to newer and stranger forms of humour? Surely all social media accounts dedicated to people&#8217;s cats are the same?

Wrong, wrong, and wrong. One word: [peepee](http://twitter.com/peepeeplayhouse).

peepee the cat has been on Twitter for several months, but until recently, remained mostly a cult account. After a few posts on the platform blew up, his followers grew to several thousand. And it is *his* account—you won&#8217;t hear from his dad, mom, or anyone else—just peepee&#8217;s thoughts, and of course a lot of pictures of him. It&#8217;s a charming, cute little place that lives up to its &#8220;playhouse&#8221; username.

Earlier this month, peepee kindly granted VRV an exclusive interview in which he discusses his origins, his philosophy, and his friends. Enjoy.
