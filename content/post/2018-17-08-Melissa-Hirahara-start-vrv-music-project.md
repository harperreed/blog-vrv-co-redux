Our first track is titled ‚ÄúEnter the Vault (Prod. by VRV)‚Äù by DDRKirby(ISQ), with cover art modeled by Maryam Khaleghi. Give the track a listen below and tell us what you think! You&#8217;ll also be able to listen to the track while walking through the VRV Gallery, alongside other musical partnerships down the line. As for the cover art, we&#8217;d love for it to become a unique and interactive way to experience VRV.

All of these creative initiatives, from the artists&#8217; interpretations of VRV to all the installations in the VRV Gallery are our ways of showcasing the independent artists and creators we&#8217;ve collaborated with. We&#8217;re proud to work with, support, and promote original content‚Äîall to bring you the best talent from around the world.
