The best kept secret of the so-called Berlin School and a contemporary of Christian Petzold, Thomas Arslan, and Maren Ade, Angela Schanelec’s films compose one of the most coherent, compact bodies of work in today&#8217;s cinema. MUBI&#8217;s retrospective spans the last 15 years of her career, building to her latest beguiling enigma: Locarno Festival favorite ***The Dreamed Path***. Interested in the ineffable side of human relationships, Schanelec’s films examine the fragmentation of German identity after the fall of the wall with stories of individuals and families longing for fulfillment.

## Claude Sautet: A French Classic

![](https://i2.wp.com/vrvblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/4-3.jpg?resize=600%2C335&#038;ssl=1)

A successful and popular director in his home country, Claude Sautet has never had the auteur reputation or cache as the directors of the French New Wave who were his contemporaries. But Sautet had few peers when it came to crafting beautifully scaled, nuanced and deeply understanding dramas of human relations — moving qualities that are on display in MUBI’s four-film retrospective.

**Max and the Junkmen | dir. Claude Sautet | 1971 | MUBI release on May 26**

## **May ‘68 *— Exclusive***

In honor of the 50th anniversary of May &#8217;68, MUBI presents Romain Goupil’s moving portrait of the French artists and intellectuals  who lived through the failed revolution — and subsequent fallout. This newly restored doc from the ‘80s captures the essence of the disillusionment among French radicals during those incredibly pivotal years.

**Half a Life | dir. Romain Goupil | 1982 | MUBI release on May 30**

Combining home movies, archival footage, and interviews, Goupil recounts his youth in the years leading up to May 1968, and the decade following it, climaxing with the suicide of his friend Michel Recanati. Both bildungsroman and political essay, the film shows how after revolt came disillusionment.
