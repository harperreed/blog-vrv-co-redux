Music is the backbone of a good movie or show. But sometimes there’s more to the story when it comes to the composers behind our favorite titles!

It’s a pretty magical tale: an American DJ works with his favorite Japanese animation studio to create the perfect music video to accompany his new single—and that’s exactly what happened with Shelter! The story behind this critically acclaimed anime short may be well known, but that doesn’t make it any less special.

[Bee and Puppycat](https://vrv.co/series/GRDQ41V1Y/Bee-and-PuppyCat) and Baths

You might have noticed the excellent, chilled out beats in Bee and Puppycat’s soundtrack, but did you know they come courtesy of a celebrated indie electronic musician? Baths (aka Will Wiesenfield) is an American singer and producer of off-kilter, poppy songs whose work also shows up in the popular video game Dream Daddy: a Dad Dating Simulator!

[Drifters](https://vrv.co/series/G609J71E6/Drifters) and Minutes Til Midnight

It’s not often that non-Japanese musicians can say their song was an anime theme song, but that’s exactly what happened with California-based Minutes Til Midnight! The 2016 action series Drifters chose the alt-rock swagger of Midnight’s “Gospel of Throttle” for their opening theme, and, honestly, it’s a perfect fit.

[Bravest Warriors](https://vrv.co/series/GYP8VJJQY/Bravest-Warriors) and Anamanaguchi

Are you a fan of video game music? If so you should definitely check out Bravest Warriors! The show’s theme song was co-written by Peter Berkman of the chiptune band Anamanaguchi. Berkman and his bandmates use Nintendo Gameboy soundboards alongside traditional instruments to make songs that blend video game nostalgia with power pop—a sensibility that holds true in this theme song!

[Beyond the Black Rainbow](https://vrv.co/watch/GY3VDJX4R/Beyond-The-Black-Rainbow) and Sinoia Caves

The surreal sci-fi horror film Beyond the Black Rainbow is a hugely atmospheric experience. The film’s soundtrack by Sinoia Waves is incredibly effective at building a sinister mood through its dark, synth-heavy soundscapes. Jeremy Schmidt, the man behind Sinoia Waves, is also part of the Canadian indie rock group Black Mountain, whose psychedelic riffs would go hand in hand with Rainbow’s experimental visuals.

[Kuso](https://vrv.co/watch/GYE5Z1JXR/Kuso) and Flying Lotus

Our last entry on this list is also the most interesting! Steven Ellison, under the moniker Flying Lotus, is a high-profile DJ and producer and he has pretty deep connections to the horror film Kuso—he created it! That’s right, besides lending his musical talent to the film, Ellison also directed and co-wrote the feature. As if that wasn’t enough of a hook, the movie also includes music from EDM pioneer Aphex Twin, funk musician Thundercat, and Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka!
