[*Boys Over Flowers*](https://vrv.co/series/GRDQJD9KY/Boys-Over-Flowers?utm_source=editorial_vrv&amp;utm_medium=blog_vrv&amp;utm_campaign=bringing-the-drama-whats-new-about-the-new-boys-over-flowers) is a contemporary *shoujo* classing for fans of both manga and anime. It&#8217;s such a fan favorite, in fact, that there have been *five* live-action series based on it! The most recent, from 2009, hails from South Korea and features all the same characters you&#8217;ve come to know and love from the original series and all its iterations.

But just how close does the K-drama come to the original? Surprisingly close&#8230; with a dash of surprisingly different.

On the surface, the story is almost identical. We have Jan-Di (formerly Tsukushi), a strong-willed lower-class girl going to an upper-class school. We have the F4, the school&#8217;s richest and handsomest boys, holding a terrifying amount of sway over the student body. And we see what happens when Jan-Di dares to go toe-to-toe with Jun-Pyo (Tsukasa), the highest ranking and ostensibly cruelest member of the F4.

Fans of the original will be a little surprised at just how Jan-Di gets into the prestigious Shinhwa High, though. In the original iteration, our heroine is already in the high-end school, pushed there by her parents in an attempt to get her to marry herself (and them) out of poverty. But when we meet Jan-Di in the drama, she&#8217;s happily working away making deliveries for her dad&#8217;s dry-cleaning company. It just so happens that her most recent customer attends Shinhwa. Not only that&#8230; he&#8217;s currently on the highest ledge of the school, preparing to jump because of F4&#8217;s declaration of war against him.

Before the first episode has even gotten fully underway, Jan-Di has become something of a local hero, giving the rich kids a piece of her mind and talking a stranger down from suicide. &#8220;Wonder Girl&#8221; is a source of pride for the lower-class community&#8230; and a major headache for the school as they deal with press inquiries concerning their methods. To put out the fire, the school offers Jan-Di a swimming scholarship &#8212; which her parents accept despite her very noisy disapproval.

From there, and with an extremely tense undercurrent as everyone knows who Jan-Di is and what she thinks of them, the story continues in a very familiar vein. Jan-Di defends a fellow student against the F4, she gets a declaration of war against her, and she reacts in a manner the school&#8217;s four faves aren&#8217;t at all used to.

If you&#8217;re a fan of soft-spoken violinist Rui and his love triangle with Tsukushi and the model Shizuka, you&#8217;ll see it played out again here, too. Ji-Hoo (Rui) still chats with Jan-Di in private, still has the same background, and once again carries a torch for model and Shinhwa alum Seo-Hyun (Shizuka). And Seo-Hyun treats Jan-Di to some memorable Cinderella moments, of course!

Fans of the relationship between F4 member Sojiro and Tsukushi&#8217;s friend Yuki will have more to look forward to. Now called Yi-Jung and Ga-Eul, the pair get more screen time and more focus on how their interaction changes the ways of the former Casanova.

Most of all, though, there&#8217;s a brand new sort of chemistry between the two leads. Ku Hye-Sun as Jan-Di and Lee Min-Ho as Jun-Pyo are both unafraid to go completely over-the-top when it comes to comedy, drama, fights, or a combination of all three within one scene. They&#8217;re an equal match, and while Jun-Pyo&#8217;s pranks and advances go beyond the acceptable (and occasionally the logical &#8212; how he rounded up enough ducks to fill the school&#8217;s pool is the subject of a whole other article!), Jan-Di has it in her to give back as good as she gets.

So, if you&#8217;re a devoted *Boys Over Flowers* fan, is the new drama worth watching? Absolutely. It follows the same route with lots of the same beats, albeit changed up to suit the locale. But the new cast, with a storyline tweaked to move different elements in and out of the spotlight, allows new perspectives on familiar beloved characters. It&#8217;s no wonder it was a hit in Korea and continues finding fans worldwide, to the point of their filming locations becoming tourist attractions.

As an added bonus, there are *many* extended montages of rich boys getting dressed in fancy clothes, all set to an awesome K-pop soundtrack. Those in and of themselves are worth a marathon.

Ready to dive in? Korea&#8217;s *Boys Over Flowers* will give you more than 25 hours of romance, pranks, travel, and super fancy clothes to gawk over.
