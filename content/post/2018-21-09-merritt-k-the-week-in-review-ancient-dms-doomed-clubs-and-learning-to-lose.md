It&#8217;s time for a VRV Blog recap, where I bring you up to speed on a few of the stories we published this week. As my good friend Super Mario would say, here we go.

Fellas, is it gay to be in a forbidden lesbian relationship in which everyone is scamming everyone else and sensuality is expressed through dental care? That&#8217;s the question tackled by [this week&#8217;s In the Flesh](https://vrvblog.co/felker-martin/3026/pain-is-a-garment-pornography-and-sexuality-in-park-chan-wooks-the-handmaiden/), Gretchen Felker-Martin&#8217;s Monday column on all things gruesome, wet, and frightening. Kind of. If already read it and want more—and let&#8217;s be honest, you do—then check out her past pieces on [the monsters of Star Wars](https://vrvblog.co/felker-martin/2925/making-monsters-the-enduring-appeal-of-star-wars-creature-design/), [women in horror](https://vrvblog.co/felker-martin/2449/the-cursed-interior-women-in-horror/), [female-directed horror films](https://vrvblog.co/felker-martin/2794/am-i-your-girl-the-female-gaze-in-horror-film/), and [Akira](https://vrvblog.co/felker-martin/2555/akira-boys/).

Yesterday, Hazel Southwall wrote a raw and honest account of [her experiences trying to run a fan convention](https://vrvblog.co/southwell/3115/moderating-the-hacienda-how-not-to-run-a-convention/). When Hazel came to me with the idea to compare her trials with those of the famously ill-fated Haçienda in Manchester, I immediately jumped on it—and not just because *24 Hour Party People *is one of my favorite films. By looking at the patterns found across enthusiast-run projects, she identifies some common problems that anyone organizing any kind of community event should be aware of.

Where did we come from? Who were our ancestors? What can we learn about ourselves by looking back in time? Josh Greenberg&#8217;s piece on [ancient &#8220;delivered mail&#8221;](https://vrvblog.co/greenberg/3044/what-we-can-learn-from-4000-year-old-sumerian-dms/) (DMs) takes us back to the past by providing examples of Sumerian personal letters. It turns out people are pretty much people wherever and whenever you look—ancient humans complained about everything too, only on stone tablets rather than&#8230; metal tablets.

Speaking of going back to the past, I hope you&#8217;ll permit me the editorial indulgence of republishing my [essay on the Angry Video Game Nerd](https://vrvblog.co/merrittk/3084/you-cant-go-home-again-the-legacy-of-the-angry-video-game-nerd/)—it&#8217;s one of my favorite things I&#8217;ve ever written. Back when it was originally published at ZEAL, James Rolfe tweeted about it and even told me he liked it. When I wrote about the L.A. Beast, I got legal threats.

Well, you can&#8217;t win &#8217;em all, as the heroes of *My Hero Academia *and *Kingdom Hearts *show us. Terence Wiggins essay on heroes argues that they can help us forgive ourselves for our own shortcomings [by failing](https://vrvblog.co/wiggins/3058/hero-rolemodels/). Winning is all well and good, but as they say, you&#8217;ve also got to learn to lose. This is something I am not terribly good at, and it&#8217;s why I mostly only play cooperative games. I once rage-uninstalled *Overwatch* because I kept losing, and followed that up by rage-cancelling my PSN membership. I could probably take a few pointers from this piece.

There&#8217;s lots more to read this week, so check it out and tell us what you think on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/watchvrv). Next week, we&#8217;ve got ping pong, Harry Potter, camming, and more, so smash that metaphorical subscribe button in your heart. As my dear chum Super Mario would say, nighty nighty. Ah spaghetti. Ah, ravioli. Ahh, mama mia.
