Well friends, it&#8217;s that special time of the month again—the time when I take a look at an anime I&#8217;ve never seen before, try to guess what it&#8217;s about, and then write about it.

Just like last time, I gave Twitter three choices. And while in the first installment of this feature I easily guessed what the outcome was going to be in advance, this time I was pretty surprised! Sorry, *DARLING in the FRANXX*, maybe next time.

> it&#39;s that time again! which of these shows that i&#39;ve never seen would you like me to take a stab at, watch, and then write about expectations v reality for [@WatchVRV](https://twitter.com/WatchVRV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

## What I Think I Know

I&#8217;ve of course never seen the [newest iteration of *Lupin the 3rd*](https://vrv.co/series/GYKE9NP1Y/LUPIN-THE-3rd-PART-5), which is after all the premise here. But I know it&#8217;s a long-running series about a guy named Arsène Lupin who is a descendent of a fictional French thief. True to his lineage, Lupin also does crimes. I&#8217;m picturing a kind of cat burglar, stealing as much for the monetary gain as for the thrill.

Lupin has a group of friends that includes a sexy lady and a big muscle guy. They help him do the crimes by distracting guards and maybe sometimes hitting guards. I feel like there&#8217;s some kind of animal friend too, maybe a talking dog.

I have actually seen a couple of episodes of one of the versions of the *Lupin* series, which aired back on Canadian television sometime in the late 90s, on our pale imitiation of Cartoon Network called Teletoon. All I remember from this series is that Lupin is kind of a scrawny dude in a suit and also that in the introduction the announcer very dramatically said &#8220;Arsène Lupin!&#8221; I&#8217;ll be honest, the space in my brain devoted to French-inspired cartoons was pretty much entirely taken up by *Cybersix* at the time.

What else? I saw a clip of one of the recent series where Lupin and his friends honk on a huge weed cigarette. His sexy lady friend is extremely hot. Oh, and back when I used to play Dance Dance Revolution every weekend, I remember there being a song called &#8220;Lupin the 3rd &#8217;78&#8221; that I&#8217;m assuming was a remixed version of the show&#8217;s theme song.

## And the Truth Is&#8230;

Arsène Lupin III is a gentleman thief who, in modern day France, has decided to steal the ultimate prize: Bitcoins. Assisted by his friends Jigen, a bearded gunman with no eyes, and Goemon, a literal samurai, he breaks into an underwater data center and convinces a teenage hacker named Ami to help him steal the cryptocurrency in exchange for spiriting her away. Lupin is a bit of a goofball but seems to have a good heart, and his choice of such a well-protected target suggests he&#8217;s in it for the thrill as much as the money.

However, the shadowy dark web network Lupin&#8217;s robbed doesn&#8217;t take things sitting down. They develop an online game complete with leaderboards where the goal is to track Lupin&#8217;s movements. Lupin, who apparently doesn&#8217;t online at all, takes a while to catch on but once he does, flees to an island outside of his nemesis Zenigata&#8217;s jurisdiction, where he becomes a social media influencer in a bid to make the Lupin game boring. Things backfire on him, however, when his dark web enemies start a different game—a betting pool on when he&#8217;ll die—which causes unscrupulous gamblers to hire assassins in an attempt to win the jackpot.

So, what did I get right? Well, I pretty much nailed Lupin&#8217;s character. His friends&#8230; not so much. I thought there was a burly muscle guy, which I guess could correspond to Goemon. And there&#8217;s no talking dog, unless you count Jigen. Which&#8230; I mean, he is pretty hairy. Fujiko Mine is the sexy lady, though at least in this newest series she&#8217;s less of a pal and more of a frenemy, trying to kill Lupin at one point then later helping him. And yes, she has hit a bong on at least one occasion &#8212; in the film *Lupin the 3rd: The Blood Spray of Ishikawa Goemon*. She did it in a totally wack way though.

That American airing of an older *Lupin* series I thought I remembered watching as a kid? That was actually a completely unrelated show called *[Night Hood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7W4QD4ez9I)*, a Canadian-French cartoon based on the original Arsène Lupin character created by Maurice Leblanc and set in the 1930s. Whoops!

*Lupin the 3rd* is a franchise that&#8217;s existed in one form or another for an intimidatingly long amount of time (it&#8217;s turned fifty in 2017!) but I found *Part 5* easy to get into. It&#8217;s a simple premise—a gentleman thief with a cop nemesis—and the modern setting featuring digital crimes and social media antics is super fun. As of this writing [fewer than ten episodes have aired](https://vrv.co/series/GYKE9NP1Y/LUPIN-THE-3rd-PART-5), so it&#8217;s a great time to jump in Lupin&#8217;s rocket-powered car and strap in for a #crime adventure.

Oh, and [the theme song totally bangs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK9aXTnzOt8).
