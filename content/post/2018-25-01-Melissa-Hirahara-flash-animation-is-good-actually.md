Hi, my name is Mel and I run VRV social. I&#8217;m here to tell you that flash animation is Good, actually. If you’re like me and the many others who grew up with the internet, I know that when you hear the words “Adobe Flash,” you immediately think of hours of amateur animation on Newgrounds.

The animation, often done by one artist and not a studio, lacked the polish and flow of professional hand drawn animation. Because Flash allows animators to create moveable models based off of their hand-drawn illustrations, it’s easy to see where it saves time during the animation process. But not all Flash animation is bad or cheaply made.

[Ping Pong the animation](https://vrv.co/series/GRJQV0N3Y/Ping-Pong-the-Animation) received universal acclaim for it’s stylized and impressionistic animation. The first anime to be produced by Masaaki Yuasa’s Science SARU, it used Flash to save labor while creating its sophisticated turning and zooming shots.

The intense action sequences of Ankama’s [Dofus](https://vrv.co/series/GY3V5J2ER/Dofus-Kerubs-Bazaar) were also accomplished using Flash. Ankama uses Flash with the intention to create animation with the same complexity as anime. Ankama also uses Flash to design their MMORPG, using it to bring their in-game sprites to life.

Remember Saturday morning favorites, like ¡Mucha Lucha! and Foster’s Home for Imaginary Friends? Mucha Lucha, which began airing in 2002, was the first show animated entirely in Adobe Flash to be broadcast on television. And Foster&#8217;s Home for Imaginary Friends was the first Cartoon Network show to do the same.

Despite its reputation, the results of Flash animation speak for themselves.
