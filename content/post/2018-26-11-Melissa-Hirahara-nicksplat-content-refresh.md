The moment you’ve all been waiting for is here—More NickSplat content is coming to VRV! For the first time since the channel launch, all episodes of select series will be available to stream on VRV. Here’s a handy list of which shows will be there in full starting tomorrow, November 27th:

- All Grown Up **(NEW!)**
- The Amanda Show
- Catdog
- Kenan & Kel
- Rocket Power
- Rocko&#8217;s Modern Life

# What Do I Do?

If you’re familiar with what happened last time, as new series come on, other series get rotated out. So, if you haven’t been able to watch these shows, today is your last chance to do so!

- All That!
- Angry Beavers
- Doug
- Wild Thornberry’s
- Chalkzone
- Clarissa Explains It All
- Kablam!
- Salute Your Shorts
- Figure It Out!
- Guts

Don&#8217;t worry about staying up all night to watch it all, though! Next month, another series will be rotated out and you&#8217;ll be able to watch other episodes of *another* series.

We understand your frustration—we don&#8217;t want to say goodbye to these shows either. This won&#8217;t affect any other content that comes to VRV, it&#8217;s just the way NickSplat content lives on VRV.

You’ll also still be able to watch shows like *Are You Afraid of the Dark?* and both the movie and the series of *Legends of the Hidden Temple*.
