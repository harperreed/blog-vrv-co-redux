[NickSplat](https://vrv.co/nicksplat) is now available on VRV! You want *CatDog*? We&#8217;ve got [*CatDog*](https://vrv.co/series/GYP5574VY/CatDog). [*Doug*](https://vrv.co/series/GYJ0QG786/Doug)? He&#8217;s here too. [*The Angry Beavers*](https://vrv.co/series/GY24PDPMR/The-Angry-Beavers)? Both of them.

Personally, I&#8217;m most excited to dig into the game shows of my youth—*[Guts](https://vrv.co/series/GYDKK98D6/Guts)* in particular*. *Which reminds me, a friend of mine back in primary school claimed to have been on the show and that she&#8217;d even won a piece of the formidable Aggro Crag. But for some reason, she could never show it to us. Come to think of it, she might have been lying about the whole thing.

To celebrate the NickSplat launch, we&#8217;ll have contributors reflecting on their favorite Nickelodeon memories throughout the week. I kicked things off by [reminiscing about how much *Are You Afraid of the Dark?* terrified me as a kid.](https://vrvblog.co/merrittk/2611/yes-i-am-afraid-of-the-dark-thanks-for-asking/)

But wait, there&#8217;s more—VRV is hosting a series of events around the US starting in Santa Monica the weekend of September 7. It&#8217;s going to be the closest thing to a classic Saturday morning short of building a time machine and heading back to 1998, where you can tell your child self that one day she won&#8217;t be beholden to TV schedules and will be able to get her [*Rocko&#8217;s Modern Life*](https://vrv.co/series/GYW4EQE06/Rockos-Modern-Life) fix anytime, anywhere.

You can get NickSplat for $5.99 on its own, or as a part of VRV Premium, which includes access to tons of other great content. Head over to the [NickSplat channel guide](https://vrv.co/nicksplatguide/index.html) for more info on all the shows available. We&#8217;ll be rotating through content over the coming months, so stay tuned for more information on scheduling and show announcements!
