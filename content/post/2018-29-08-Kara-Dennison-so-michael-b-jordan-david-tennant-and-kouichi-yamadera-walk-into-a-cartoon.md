Rooster Teeth&#8217;s done some frankly amazing stuff in its time. From humble beginnings as a drunk game review podcast to being creators of content beloved worldwide, this group of fans from Texas continue to push the envelope. Their next project, *gen:LOCK,* is already looking promising—not least of all because it features some world-class talent.

According to show creator Gray G. Haddock, the eight-episode series will pull from several inspirations: real robot series like the *Gundam* saga, cyberpunk anime like *Ghost in the Shell,* and the works of Gen Urobochi. Fans can look forward to mecha action, but Haddock emphasizes that *gen:LOCK* won&#8217;t be falling into any one specific genre. It&#8217;s appropriate, then, that their cast is from all over the entertainment map.

In the lead role of Julian Chase will be a guy we&#8217;ve personally loved hearing about lately: Michael B. Jordan. The *Friday Night Lights* star recently came to broad public attention as Killmonger in *Black Panther.* But anime fans know him as one of our own, thanks to his open love of anime on social media.

And speaking of anime, long-time dub actress and producer Monica Rial will be stepping into the role of Raquel Marin. If you take your anime dubbed, you&#8217;ve almost certainly heard her. From Misa in *Macross* to Hyatt in *Excel Saga,* and most recently Asirpa in *Golden Kamuy* and Tomie in *Junji Ito Collection,* she&#8217;s got more roles under her belt than even we can keep track of.

But *gen:LOCK* is reaching across the Pacific for anime stars, too. Voice actor Kouichi Yamadera will be appearing as a character named Kazu Iida. Yamadera&#8217;s resume is massive, including Spike Spiegel in *Cowboy Bebop,* Togusa in *Ghost in the Shell,* and Kaji in *Evangelion.* He&#8217;s also taken over as the new voice of Inspector Zenigata in the *Lupin III* TV series and films.

One of the show&#8217;s other huge gets is Scottish actor David Tennant, known worldwide for taking over the role of everyone&#8217;s favorite world-saving, adventuring children&#8217;s hero: Scrooge McDuck. (Oh, and of course he was the Tenth Doctor.) Tennant will play the referentially-named &#8220;Doc&#8221; Weller, the guy behind the tech that powers the show&#8217;s mechs.

Dakota Fanning rounds out the team in the role of Miranda Worth. Fanning first rose to stardom at the age of 8 for her role in *I Am Sam,* and has been building an impressive resume ever since. She&#8217;s no stranger to voice acting, having lent her voice to the dub of *My Neighbor Totoro* and playing the title character in *Coraline.* Most recently, she&#8217;s played a lead role in period TV thriller *The Alienist.*

And that&#8217;s just the cast *so far.* The series premieres next year, so there will probably be more amazing announcements to come. But the star power of this series as it stands is already impressive. And in case you&#8217;re wondering what these awesome people look like in animated form, Rooster Teeth has just dropped [character sheets](https://www.facebook.com/roosterteeth/posts/1878093575583502?__tn__=-R) for Julian and Miranda.

Michael B. Jordan&#8217;s Julian is looking especially slick, and we can only imagine how excited he is for the character. While we&#8217;d seen some art of him in battle gear before, we really love the addition of the dress uniform (and are kind of high-key hoping Jordan will cosplay his own character)!

Miranda&#8217;s got a great look to her, too, with a heavy-duty mech pilot suit reminiscent of old-school *Gundam* pilots. And if her cool civilian outfit is any indication, the day-to-day aesthetic of the world of *gen:LOCK* is going to look super-cool.

We can&#8217;t wait to meet everyone&#8217;s characters when *gen:LOCK *premieres next January.
