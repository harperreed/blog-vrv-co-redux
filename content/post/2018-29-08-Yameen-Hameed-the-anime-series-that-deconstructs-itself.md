The key to a successful comedy series lies in establishing circumstances for characters’ antics and misadventures. When a series sets up a reliable framework, new episodes can build upon that identity while still staying fresh with new jokes. This can be seen in all sorts of episodic comedies including gag anime, which typically build their identity around a world ruled by bizarre logic or fantasy elements. The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. does just this by shaping an otherwise normal world around its hapless, psychic protagonist.

Saiki Kusuo is a boy trying to hide his psychic powers from those around him, but his abilities are so strong that they prevent him from living a peaceful life—he needs to wear antenna-like limiters on his head or he risks accidentally destroying the planet. His telepathy is always active, so he&#8217;s stuck hearing other people’s thoughts nonstop. In fact, Saiki’s psychic powers have made him so perceptive that he even knows he’s an anime character. The series uses this idea to justify Saiki narrating every episode directly to the viewers. Instead of just being the punchline for a joke or two, this metanarrative concept establishes the ridiculous story world to continuously provide material for gags.

The prime example of the story world’s connection to the fourth wall comes from Saiki’s mass mind control ability, which explains the presence of many common anime tropes. After being born with pink hair in the predominantly black-haired country of Japan, Saiki brainwashes the entire world to believe that all hair colors are normal. Saiki’s mind control is so effective that it somehow alters people’s DNA, causing these hair colors to naturally appear globally. Similarly, Saiki wills it that most injuries heal instantly, that people can think in complete sentences in a fraction of a second, and that they can be knocked unconscious with a single chop to the back. By attempting to rationalize slapstick humor, the series deconstructs elements of comedy anime.

The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. is far from the only comedy anime to frequently use meta-humor. Other series like Gintama and Cromartie High School break the fourth wall regularly, with *Gintama* even including a story arc centered around the results of an official character popularity poll. However, The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. distinguishes itself by using Saiki’s powers to integrate that humor directly into the laws of the show’s universe. In many ways, the anachronistic alien-occupied Edo in Gintama and the eponymous Cromartie High School are more bizarre than the setting of Saiki K. And if it weren’t for Saiki himself, it’s implied that the world of the series would be a typical slice-of-life anime in a Japanese high school. Just by existing, Saiki has molded the world he lives in and become its center.

Despite successfully hiding his abilities from most of his peers, Saiki still frequently receives unwanted attention from the other characters who are naturally drawn to him without realizing why. This further solidifies the idea that the world revolves around him—the main character—despite the fact that he never wants to stand out. Saiki’s magnetism leads to an interesting juxtaposition with his classmates, who act like the main characters of other anime genres. Viewing such characters from the perspective of an esper who can read their thoughts draws attention to how ridiculous those character archetypes seem in a different setting. For example, the school jock acts like an energetic sports anime character who never gives up, but he comes across as more comical than inspirational when we see him treat gym class dodgeball like a life-or-death scenario.

Another aspect of the series’ world-building involves the specifications and limits of Saiki’s capabilities in his everyday life as an esper. Saiki has a wide range of abilities for almost every scenario including teleportation and precognition, as well as powers not traditionally associated with ESP—such as super strength and transformation. Each of these is meticulously explained, establishing rules behind his abilities that sometimes feel like a light-hearted take on the complex Nen system of superpowers from Hunter x Hunter. Saiki’s abilities seem capable of solving any given problem, but there’s always a catch tied to their limitations or the incompetence of everyone around him.

For example, Saiki is capable of teleporting any object through apportation, but only if he’s exchanging the object for something with an equivalent monetary cost. In one episode, Saiki uses this ability to save a classmate’s failing relationship by swapping out the boyfriend’s crappy gift of leftover squid jerky for a stuffed animal last second. These sorts of complex solutions to everyday scenarios are the basis of the conflicts in almost every episode.

The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. may appear to be just another episodic gag anime about goofy characters dealing with everyday scenarios, but it’s unique because of its compelling in-universe explanation for the complete annihilation of the fourth wall. This allows for some truly great comedy setups that deconstruct well-established anime tropes audiences have come to take for granted. So while Saiki himself may not want attention, his anime has certainly earned it.
