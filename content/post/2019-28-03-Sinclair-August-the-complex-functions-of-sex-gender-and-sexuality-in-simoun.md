It’s worth remembering that as different as Simoun&#8217;s world is, it’s still colored by the ideas of the society in which it was produced.

The world of *[Simoun](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0991062/)*has a striking conceit&#8211;everyone is born female and chooses their permanent sex at 17, with the exception of priestesses called sybilla who pilot divine war machines. As one might expect, this large of a divergence from the way sex and gender functions in real life leads to a certain amount of complexity in the way gender identity, sexuality, and gender roles are written&#8211;especially considering how its depiction is inevitably colored by the context in which it was conceived. Rather than simply being an objective depiction of a society that has developed naturally over hundreds or thousands of years, *Simoun *was written in 2006 by Mari Okada, who is&#8211;by all appearances&#8211;a cisgender woman. Despite the unique and thought-provoking nature of the setting, it’s inevitable that a certain amount of modern assumptions would slip in unnoticed.

First, some groundwork. Humans in our world are assigned either male, female, or intersex at birth&#8211;the majority of the time, they also identify with the associated gender, and go through the rest of their lives without thinking too deeply about it. This is referred to as being cisgender, or cis. Those who don’t identify with their assigned sex&#8211;whether they identify as the “opposite,” nonbinary, or something else entirely&#8211;are generally referred to under the spectrum of trans.

This is not the case in the world of *Simoun*. Everyone is born not just gender-neutral, but *female*, with both the secondary sexual characteristics&#8211;i.e. breasts, wider hips, and higher voices&#8211;that this would suggest, and a certain amount of what we would consider female-coded behavior as well. Characters act “feminine” in a way the viewer recognizes&#8211;even some of those who later choose to become male. Conventional femininity&#8211;both in appearance and behavior&#8211;is taken as the default, presumably because people are born with female bodies. In addition, many of the characters who act the most “masculine” choose to remain/become female&#8211;so there’s no way to gauge identity based on behavior.

Moreover, the concept of gender identity as it exists in our society doesn’t seem to exist the same way in the world of *Simoun*. There doesn’t seem to be any internal compass, so to speak&#8211;as a nonbinary individual, I don’t identify as either male or female not because the associated gender roles don’t appeal to me, but because it simply *doesn’t feel right* in a way that’s hard to explain. However, when we see people deliberating over what sex to choose in *Simoun*, the reasons they give are nearly always based in gender roles&#8211;and moreover, gender roles that are very similar to the ones in most human societies. The vast majority of the mechanics, soldiers, and military commanders we see throughout the series are male. Several characters express a desire to become male so that they can have the strength to protect someone they care about&#8211;usually someone they assume will become/remain female.

This ties into another interesting point of *Simoun*’s society&#8211;sexuality. Or specifically, the fact that heterosexuality appears to be the norm. A sybilla assures a boy she’s flirting with that she intends to become/remain female; another showers with a recently transitioned man, telling him not to be self-conscious because she intends to become male. There’s at least one case of a sybilla choosing to become/remain female so that she can be romantically involved with the man she has feelings for. The only explicit couples we see are men and women.

There are two ways to interpret the ways in which gender identity and sexuality are depicted. The first is that in the world of *Simoun*, internal gender identity simply doesn’t exist&#8211;people can’t be cis or trans because there’s no distinction between mental gender and physical sex. Assuming this, it’s perhaps unsurprising that such firm gender roles would exist&#8211;if you want to go into a career that’s considered masculine, you can just become a man, or vice-versa. Everyone has the same opportunity, so there’s no unfairness the way there is in human society. Same with sexuality&#8211;it makes sense that heterosexuality would be favored, as only heterosexual couples can reproduce, so people could choose their sex based on which gender they’re most attracted to. There would naturally be issues if these two potential reasons came into contradiction with one another, but it’s not implausible.

The second way to interpret this is that the society that produced the fictional world of *Simoun *has the above preconceived notions about gender and sexuality, and Okada was more interested in constructing a narrative about gender that would resonate with women than delving into the nuances of gender in a completely original speculative fiction universe. Male and female gender roles exist in *Simoun *the way that they do so the sybilla who think the only way they can have the strength to protect the ones they love can realize they’re wrong, and they’re just as capable of doing so as women. This is narrative is&#8211;in and of itself&#8211;an honorable goal. What complicates it is context.

It’s not uncommon to see trans narratives and imagery appropriated to say something about cis gender roles. Persona 4’s Naoto Shirogane comes to mind&#8211;a male-presenting detective who was assigned female, Naoto’s arc turns out to be about accepting that she doesn’t have to present as a boy to be taken seriously. Which, again, is not bad in and of itself. It’s just that there are so many stories about women who dress up as men only to realize they were strong enough on their own all along, and so few about dealing with the strain of being born into a body that isn’t right for you and going through your life being seen as something you’re not. A world like *Simoun*’s&#8211;where gender is both placed so much in the forefront and is so different from ours&#8211;would be ripe for exploring this. But instead, choosing one’s sex is equated with becoming an adult&#8211;and by extension, not wanting to choose is childish escapism. It’s an overly simple way to look at something that reflects an incredibly complex real-world issue. Not to mention more than a little insulting to nonbinary people.

What makes it especially frustrating is that there are places where the potential shines through. In the second episode, one of the priestesses&#8211;Eri&#8211;goes to choose her permanent sex, only to find herself unable to decide. At the very last second, the choice to become a man is made for her&#8211;the newly dubbed Erif attempts to reassure himself that nothing’s really different, only to break down in tears when called by his new masculine name. It resonates so much it hurts&#8211;being nonbinary is hard enough when the choice is made for you from the start. Being forced to choose between being male or female when neither is right would have to be unimaginably painful.

There is also the matter of Anubituf and Guragief&#8211;commanders of the warship where most of the series takes place and former sybilla. It’s implied that they were lovers before they became male, and quite possibly remain so&#8211;at one point, Anubituf kisses Guragief, saying “You might still be a sybilla, even now,” and they remain together even after the end of the war. It’s a possible same-sex relationship and an implication of gender non-conformity on the part of Guragief&#8211;whether he identifies as nonbinary or female, it seems clear enough his main reason for becoming male was to act as commander alongside Anubituf&#8211;making them a striking diversion from the usual portrayals of gender and sexuality in the show.

As imperfect and often frustrating as *Simoun *is in its narrative and world-building, it’s still a fascinating and thought-provoking look at a world very different from ours&#8211;it’s just worth remembering that as different as it is, it’s still colored by the ideas of the society in which it was produced.
